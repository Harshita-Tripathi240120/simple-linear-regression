Simple Linear Regression Model
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of Linear Regression, a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.

The model fits a linear equation of the form:

≈∑ = B‚ÇÄ + B‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ + B‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ + ... + B‚Çôx‚Çô
It optimizes the coefficients (B‚ÇÄ to B‚Çô) by minimizing the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) between the actual target values (y) and the predicted values (≈∑).
